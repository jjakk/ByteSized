# Python Data Types
    Python has 5 essential data types, Integer, Float, String, None and Boolean. Integers or an int are a representation of whole numbers, positive or negative. Floating or a float numbers are a representation of whole numbers that includes the decimal point. Strings or a str are a combination of characters and is python’s way of interpreting non-numerical values, however, a string can contain numbers.

    Booleans or a bool represents True or False values. Finally, The None data type represents a null or empty variable, and is Python’s way of creating an empty variable. Each of these data types have their own unique interactions and methods that can be utilized to create complex Python programs.
