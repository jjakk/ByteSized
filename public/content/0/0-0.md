# The Bit
    What is Binary? Binary is the representation of data through two values, a 1 (which represents True) or a 0 (which represents False). Each value represents a bit and 4 of these bits represent a byte. Let’s take 110101 for example, the right most position represents 2^0 or 1 and each digit from the left of that increases by a factor of 2

    To determine the actual integer, we add together the “True” digits of the binary number together, so in the case of 110101, that would be 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 or 53, so 110101 => 53. This process can be done for 231 whole numbers and is the fundamental language of computers.
