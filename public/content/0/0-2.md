# OR/XOR Gates
<!--- Above Text --->
     The main gates in this lesson are OR and XOR. OR gates compare whether any of the input bits are 1, if any of the input bits are 1 then the OR gate will produce a 1 as well. The only case in which an OR gate produces a 0 is when none of the input bits are 1. XOR gates compares the difference between input bits, for simplicity purposes we will only focus on XOR gates with two inputs. If an XOR gate has 2 inputs, one being 1 and another being 0, then it will return 1, but if both bits are the same 0 or 1, then it will return 0.
     
     In the above example, the OR gate receives a 1 and 0, and while this outputs a 1. The 1st XOR gate receives two 0â€™s, these bits are the same which results in a 0, but it is put through a NOT gate making it a 1. Then these two results are put through a XOR gate, since they are both 1, the XOR gate produces a 0.
