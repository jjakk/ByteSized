# AND/NOT Gates
     Logic gates perform comparison operations using transistors to create a binary output from a binary input. The main gates in this lesson are AND and NOT. AND gates compare whether two or more bits are the same, if they are the same the AND gate will produce a 1, in any other case the AND gate will produce a 0. NOT gates are not for comparison, rather they are for flipping a bit to the opposite value. So if a NOT gate takes in a 1 it will produce a 0, and vice versa. Below is an example of a combination logic circuit that contains both AND and NOT gates.

     In the above example, the AND gate receives a 1 and 0, and while this outputs a 0, it is then put through a NOT gate which makes it a 1. This same logic can be applied to the bottom NOT gate and when the two results are put through the final AND gate it returns a 1 as a final value.
