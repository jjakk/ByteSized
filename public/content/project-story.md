## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was duolingo. We realized that theye weren't a lot of
quick resources to learn about some basic STEM knowledge. In this evergrowing, fast-paced, tech-world. We believe every should atleast have byteSized knowledge about computers and more.
## What it does
This project gives you quick and eazy to understand knowledge about computer and programming.
The app is structured so that it is basically one lesson per week. You can freely choose your time commitment as we don't hold you accountable to your learning (we believe inspiration is the best motivator). Each week has multiple lesson within that give you most of the knowledge you'll need about a specific topic.
## Challenges we ran into
The challenges we ran into would be very minimal in the grand scheme of things, but a challenge is a challenge. We ran into multiple issue with using Git. We didn't realize how important it is to use a good git workflow, such as feature branching and reviewing merge requests until after we messed up a little.
## What's next for ByteSized
Next for ByteSized is scaling. We would love to cover more topics in the STEM area and also expand out to beyong just CS. We want ByteSized to be a one-stop shop for all your quick STEM knwoledge needs.
