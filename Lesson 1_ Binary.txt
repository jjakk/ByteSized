What is Binary? Binary is the representation of data through two values, a 1 (which represents True) or a 0 (which represents False). Each value represents a bit and 4 of these bits represent a byte. Counting in binary is simple, you work from the rightmost digit in the number and move left. Let’s take 0110 for example, the right most position represents 20 or 1 and each digit from the left of that increases by a factor of 2. To determine the actual integer, we add together the “True” digits of the binary number together, so in the case of 110101, that would be 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 or 53, so 110101 => 53. This process can be done for 231 whole numbers and is the fundamental language of computers.
